## Who I am

I am an assistant professor in the Organizational Behavior Department for the Industrial and Labor Relations School at Cornell University.

## My research

My research uncovers the promises and perils that low-status employees face when expressing themselves at work. Using laboratory, archival, and machine learning methodologies, I problematize theoretical assumptions about how low-status employees gain (or lose) status through expressing themselves. Naturally, some of my work is grounded in the context of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. 

## Where have I been?

I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2016. While there, I was a McNair scholar. After graduating, I spent two years as a research coordinator at Stanford's Graduate School of Business before beginning my PhD at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, studying under Eric Anicich. I was a postdoc at the University of California Berkeley Haas School of Business, working with Dr. Drew Jacoby-Senghor and Sa-Kiera Hudson (shout out to Kiera's HIGHER Lab).
