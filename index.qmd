## About me

I am an assistant professor in the Organizational Behavior Department for the Industrial and Labor Relations School at Cornell University. My university webpage is [here](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/people/merrick-r-osborne).

## My research

My research uncovers the promises and perils that low-status employees face when expressing themselves at work. Using laboratory, archival, and machine learning methodologies, I problematize theoretical assumptions about how low-status employees gain (or lose) status through expressing themselves. Naturally, some of my work is grounded in the context of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. 

## Where have I been?

I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2016. While there, I was a [McNair scholar](https://our.unc.edu/news-update/mcnair-scholars-program-info-sessions/). After graduating, I spent two years as a [research coordinator at Stanford's Graduate School of Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/behavioral-lab) before beginning my PhD at the [University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/programs/graduate-programs/phd-program), studying under [Dr. Eric Anicich](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/eric-anicich). I was a postdoc at the University of California Berkeley Haas School of Business, working with Dr. Drew Jacoby-Senghor and Sa-Kiera Hudson (shout out to Kiera's [HIGHER](https://www.higherlaboratory.com/) Lab).
