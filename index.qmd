## Who I am

I am an assistant professor in the Organizational Behavior Department for the Industrial and Labor Relations School at Cornell University.

## My research

My research uncovers the promises and perils that low-status employees face when expressing themselves at work. Using laboratory, archival, and machine learning methodologies, I problematize theoretical assumptions about how low-status employees gain (or lose) status through expressing themselves. Naturally, some of my work is grounded in the context of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.
